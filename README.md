# Surfs Up!

## Overview 


Everyone dreams of moving to Hawaii, we have decided to follow this dream opening our very own surf shop in Oahu. We cannot do it alone and have therefore reached out to potential investors. One potential investor is W. Avy best known for his love of surfing. He had previously invested in a similar shop and was promptly rained out of business. Therefore, the purpose of this analysis is to examine weather patterns in Oahu Hawaii to determine the likelihood of a Surf ‘N Shake shop being rained out of business. We will be looking at the months of June and December in order to determine if opening this venue would be a waste of funds.

# Summary
Based off this information I do not foresee any temperature related issues regarding our intended venture as the range of temperatures in Oahu is moderate. 

To be thorough we have taken a closer look at the temperature data and compared the temperatures for two months in different seasons. June and December. 

•	Average June temperature is 75
•	Max temp is 85
•	Minimum Temp is 64
•	Average December temp is 71
•	Max December temp is 74
•	Minimum December Temp is 56
We can see a better visual representation of the temperature in the images below.

Precipitation may be a different matter; The image above shows the frequency of rainfall from August 2016 to August 2017. While crowded we can clearly see that precipitation peaks and falls with increases in August, January, April and July. 
August and July are warmer summer months in which many of our potential clients would be more likely to surf assuming the weather is fair.  Overall, there seem to be fewer days with heavy rainfall than there are with heavy rainfall. And with the temperature being so moderate the business venture isn’t going to be seasonal.  So, in conclusion Oahu is a tropical island with mostly warm and sunny days perfect for surfing and shakes.
